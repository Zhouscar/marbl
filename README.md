Last game have had it's inconsistencies and mistakes that I can fix in this game

Things that I can do for this game:

- Learning how to use remotes more efficient other than bidirectional components
- Tarmac
- Charm (Atom) State Manager
- React

This game is the continuation of the game Sphero, a game that I previously had but failed to because of the lack of effort from Nobrine.
Yokai has been the wrong person to work with because he is constantly dealing with his own traumas.

This game is an inspiration from the game Gunball. And I have my own philosophy surrounding what a sphere is.

And I understand that I can also get a bit protective over it and I think I can make the same mistake of misunderstanding others when I work on it.

### But, I want to have a mindset of experimenting things, and keep things experimental, rather than having a clear vision of what might have happen. Sort of like Piggy. Minimum Viable Product, use the least effort, the MOST simplest design and code, and then share it with people. This is not a game covering heavy lore. Focus DIRECTLY on the gameplay, game mechanics, core game loops, and then mastering these techniques, to convey the lore in an interesting way. But lore doesn't matter, at least not at this stage. I'll still figure it out.
