Last game have had it's inconsistencies and mistakes that I can fix in this game

Things that I can do for this game:

- Learning how to use remotes more efficient other than bidirectional components
- Tarmac
- Charm (Atom) State Manager
- React

This game is the continuation of the game Sphero, a game that I previously had but failed to because of the lack of effort from Nobrine.
Yokai has been the wrong person to work with because he is constantly dealing with his own traumas.

This game is an inspiration from the game Gunball. And I have my own philosophy surrounding what a sphere is.

### This game is a seek for forgiveness, to redempt myself from what I did to people.

## TODO

Main goal is to get the game playable, make at least one gun, movement controls and one enemy.

And something unique about the game.
